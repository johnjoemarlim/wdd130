                            Considered one of the best one day white water trips in the world, no safari to Uganda would be complete without truly experiencing the Nile from its source.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a commitment to safety, quality and value for money, Nile River Explorers focus on providing our clients with an all inclusive experience of the Nile. We take a personal interest in every detail of your day to ensure your time with us is simply unforgettable.

                            This is the ideal one day white water river trip for families with children as young as eight and 
                            those who want to experience white water rafting on the Nile without the intensity of grade 5 rapids.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            Warm water, safe pools to swim, islands full of birds and fisherman in dugouts combine with fun and 
                            white water adventure to make this the perfect family and friends day out on the Nile. Nile River Explorers 
                            is the only company that starts your day with a 40 metre water slide into the Nile. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Trip B rapids are fun without being overwhelming so there’s plenty of white water action, but also 
                            time to sit back, relax and enjoy your surrounds and have the occasional water fight.
                        </p>

                            For the not so adventurous or the not so tall, why not spend your time drifting down the Nile. Beautiful islands, birdlife and flat, slow moving water make it the ideal short family outing for both young and old.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This two hour family float is the perfect adventure for small kids. With a minimum age of 4, and plenty of opportunity to splash in the waters of the Nile, this trip provides a wonderful morning adventure for families.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This trip is a great experience for younger families and grandparents alike. For those who wish, there is plenty of places for the kids to swim, always under the watchful eyes of our safety kayakers.
