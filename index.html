            <p>Hi! My name is John Joemar Lim. I'm originally from the Philippines, but I'm currently living in Ireland with my family. I enjoy spending time with my family,
                playing games with them, and watching movies.

            <p>The Republic of Ireland occupies most of the island of Ireland, off the coast of England and Wales. Its capital, Dublin,
                 is the birthplace of writers like Oscar Wilde, and home of Guinness beer. The 9th-century Book of Kells and other
                 illustrated manuscripts are on show in Dublin's Trinity College Library. Dubbed the "Emerald Isle” for its lush landscape,
                 the country is dotted with castles like medieval Cahir Castle. ― Google</p>
