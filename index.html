                <p>Hi! My name is John Joemar Lim. I'm originally from the Philippines, but I'm currently living in Ireland with my family. I enjoy spending time with my family,
                playing games with them, and watching movies. Aside from spending time with my family, I also enjoy basketball. I'm the eldest of 4 children. I served my
                fulltime mission at Philippines Cebu and Cebu East Missions in 2012-2014. My wife is also a returned missionary and she served in Philippines Cagayan de Oro Mission in 2011-2012.
                My beautiful wife, Vanessa, and I got married in January of 2017, and we were blessed with twin daughters, Arah Virtue and Neah Chaste, in June of 2018. I'm currently working as a nurse, but I'm hoping to be a web and computer developer here in Ireland.
                We're living in Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland, at the moment but we're planning to move to a different county due to the very expensive housing
                here in the main city. My wife finished a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, and she worked as an IT Manager before. She is looking after the kids fulltime at the moment, and I'm still very proud of her. I'm very
                grateful for her sacrifices and for her love for us.
                </p>

                <p>The Republic of Ireland occupies most of the island of Ireland, off the coast of England and Wales. Its capital, Dublin,
                 is the birthplace of writers like Oscar Wilde, and home of Guinness beer. The 9th-century Book of Kells and other
                 illustrated manuscripts are on show in Dublin's Trinity College Library. Dubbed the "Emerald Isle‚Äù for its lush landscape,
                 the country is dotted with castles like medieval Cahir Castle. ‚Äï Google</p>
